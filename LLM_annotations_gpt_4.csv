Not for bass lovers.Call clarity is very good. The other side didnâÃÃ´t hear any background noise and I could hear their voice very clearly. Call clarity when connected to the aux is fine as well. No issues in attending phone calls wireless and wired.Note 1: For multiplayer gaming I connect the headphones using the aux cable but the other players are not able to hear me clearly. Wirelessly you wonâÃÃ´t be able to hear the sounds (I tested CS:GO). In single player games, the headphone supports both wireless and wired connections.Note 2: Microsoft Teams and Skype do not support these headphones. So unfortunately you have to wear your earphones to attend office calls if Microsoft teams and Skype is being used.Note 3: No audio delay on YouTube. (Tested both wireless and wired connections)Comfort: Even with my glasses on I experienced no discomfort whatsoever and the cushions are so soft I had no issues wearing these for 3-4 hours on a stretch (if your glasses have thick frames then maybe you have to adjust quite a bit but my thin wayfarer frame causes no trouble). Cushions look durable as well. Care to be taken if you are wearing these with your room temperature more than 34-35 degrees as your ears may get very warm (warm ears are not a problem it is just more of an annoyance) and also sweat will be soaked by cushions which in long-term could make you to replace cushions within a year or 14 months.Build: All plastic with matte finish. Build to last it seems but donâÃÃ´t overstretch them as plastic is plastic. Look wise they give a premium-minimalist look.The aux cable is 1.2m long but its build quality is not very good. I fear it will break if somehow it manages to get stuck on a chair arm or some other place so take care.The charging cable is micro usb (no usb type c unfortunately even when this headphone launched in year 2020 ) but charging time is super low: 2hrs for a full charge with a fast charging adapter and ~2.5hrs if connected to a laptop usb port although the charging cable is very short.The headband is cushioned so it does not hurt the top of my head even after wearing the headphones for hours.",0,1,1,1,1,0

So I had with 0 expectations reading the reviews I got it for a good price at 2800 so i just went for it.At first when I got the headphones I was dissapointed when I heard coz I put max volume on my phone nd the bass nd sound was low BUT THATS THE MISTAKE I THINK MOST PPL PUTTING THE REVIEWS COZ THATS DEFAULT SOUND which is very lowYou will have to put a song or play video it won't work otherwise AND THEN MANUALLY INCREASE THE SOUND BY CLICKING THE VOLUME BUTTONS ON THE HEADPHONES TILL U HERE A SOUND TICK SOUND WHICH MEANS IT REACHED MAX VOLUME.I did not know this I just found it and UFF the sound and bass increased SIGNIFICANLTY.SO REMEMBER TO DO THIS THIS WHEN U BUY THE HEADPHONESAfter doing that And you still want even more bass and sound then idk do you want ur head to explode or somethin coz it has VERY LOUD AND GOOD SOUND AND BASS!!OH Yes it's comfortable too not for too long but enough time life 5 or 6 hrs IF u have big ears it might hurt after sometime but for me it's PERFECT.,0,0,1,1,1,0

However, in next 10-15 mins I realized that it's not working well. Lot of noise, bluetooth kept disconnecting and very next moment, I remove my headphone and 1st ear cover  is out. It's not broken but doesn't remain Intact. I call Amazon and they say that now for electronics Items, I should contact brand and when I speak to JBL(Harman), they are keep repeating same thing  - we will pick it up as warranty claim and check , if there is internal fault, we will replace it. We don't provide refunds. While taking pics, even the 2nd ear cover is out without even changing location. It's clear case of faulty product.  Then my question is - Internal fault checking, fine? but who takes care of weird design  hardware where these ear covers are coming out without any usage? Does Brand doesn't own this problem that it should be designed in a way that ear covers remain intact atleast for a month or 6 months? It just came out within 20 mins of usage for 1 side and other side without any issues or man handling. Harman/JBL is very adamant that they are not going to provide refund or replacement for design fault, they will chk only for internal fault and replace it if they find it. All this will take 5-10 Days. So, now I have wasted my money. and stuck with broken headset. Called back Amazon customer care and after few rounds, they connected me to technical customer care who were able to ask right questions and identified that this is a defective product. Hopefully they will do a replacement. But wanted to warn all buyers about this scam where Brand will not take any responsibility if you get a defective fault. They will only test for internal issues. So, better to buy offline for this brand or switch to few better ones like Boat or others if you like comfort from Amazon shopping.",0,1,1,1,1,0
4,"Sony WH-CH520, Wireless On-Ear Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, Upto 50 Hours Playtime, DSEE Upscale, Multipoint Connectivity/Dual Pairing,Voice Assistant App Support for Mobile Phones (Blue)",https://www.amazon.in/Sony-Bluetooth-Headphones-Multipoint-Connectivity/dp/B0BS1RT9S2,"So if you're considering to buy this pair of headphones or have already brought it and need a little tweak to the sound to up the excitement, give this review a read. I know it's somewhat lengthy :( but if you've already bought this pair, skip to the last part, that is, bonus.Sound quality:-Pretty good. As you might know, Sony is Sony when it comes to sound. The audio is clear and has that calm, balanced profile that I prefer to the bass oriented profiles of BoAt and JBL. If you are a basshead, I don't think these headphones will be your go to. But if you've been using bass heavy headphones, you will feel and instant change in audio quality and the overall beauty of music once you switch to a Sony device. Keep in mind that I'm not a professional audiophile or something. I love listening to quality music and watching movies and these headphones are perfect. I use Apple music and the sound is bliss, idk about Spotify though but I think it will fare equally well. I like bass and these headphones do provide bass, just that they are not overkill and distort the entire sound looking for it. These feel more premium in the sound department. However some people might feel a lack of excitement in their sound out of the box. Worry not, I've added an EQ tweak to fix your problem at the end of this review.Specs:- 30mm drivers. So not as loud as the 40mm ones BoAt and JBL offer in this price range. But I've felt (personally) the audio quality to be better. Bluetooth 5.2 which is solid. Multipoint connection makes sure that this will not be outdated soon. They've been released in 2023 and will remain in contention for atleast a couple of years. Multipoint has to be turned on in headphones app and I use it to connect the headphones to my Macbook to watch movies and to my android phone, which might be on charging or in another room, to attend calls. The switching is seamless and works well. They don't have touch controls though, so it will take a couple of tries to learn to get the buttons right, especially in a dark room. They have DSEE which is basically a feature to enhance low quality/ compressed audios downloaded from internet. It has to be turned on in the app and is not needed for Spotify or Apple music as they are already best quality music and DSEE takes up additional battery charge. Battery is solid. They were 70% out of the box and after 20 hr playback still had 50% left. So I guess they'll last for atleast 50 hrs like they claim on the box. I don't like charging my devices all the time and I use them for max 5 hrs a day for which they will last close to 2 weeks which is good. No ANC though, it's not a problem for me but if it is for you, don't buy. Mic is good, I've attended calls in the midst of traffic and they were pretty fine.Comfort:-I've tried many midrange headphones and these are some of the best in terms of comfort too. Soft earcups that sit compact on my ear. However if they are not positioned properly, they might exert pressure. But on proper positioning, they will give 2 to 2.5 hours playback without any discomfort. After that you will have to take a break. I don't have big ears btw. They are lightweight and have an adjustable headband with cushion. So as far as on ear headphones are concerned, these are comfortable.Build:-Plastic but feels durable. Not creaking. The earcups are the types which forms wrinkles, they look durable but I don't know if they will pinch unless I use it for atleast 6 months. Anyway these have replacement earcups available online and in Sony service centers. I have one near my house. I don't think they are sweat resistant so don't use it for workouts. For jogging they will stay in place once positioned compactly, but for running they will slip off ear.Drawbacks:-Lack of aux cable. Once you are out of charge, that's that. It says they support fast charging on box, but I haven't tried that so idk. Normally takes 2 hours atleast to charge from 20 to 100. Another drawback is portability. They are not foldable and even though the plastic feels durable, I'd suggest you don't bump them much. While travelling either buy a case or carry them around in the box they come with (don't worry about looking cheap, the box doesn't have anything like specs or other bs written on it. Only thing written is Sony. It's inside the white cover that mentions specs).Conclusion:-They offer value for money if you ask me. The sound is premium for a budget segment and not too bass oriented. The headphone app means it will get firmware updates and has some listening modes that actually work, it is not a gimmick. They look and feel premium too. And unlike Anker or ATH, they have service centers all over so if any issue pops up, that's an added boost too. The don't have an in box warranty card but worry not, the moment you connect your device to the headphones app they are registered. Keep the Amazon invoice with you, in the box or download it in pdf form from your orders section.Bonus:-If the headphones lack excitement to you out of the box, the headphones app offer some preset EQ. But I will share this tweak I found from reddit. They worked for me so if you don't know how to configure the EQ on your own, try this;Select manual on EQ in Sony headphones app.Put 400 to 2.Put 1k to 4.Put 2.5k to 7.Put 6.3k to 7.Put 16k to 5.Put clear bass to 2.Try out this tweak and see if it works for you. This works on some higher end Sony models too. Enjoy your headphones!!!",1,1,1,1,1,1

It captures my voice very well, and is much better than the mic. on my phone or my webcam.The size is good.It's not too bulky so it is comfortable.The cushioning provides great comfort as well.I also used it for gaming, and it performed amazing in that as well.While the latency is inevitable in any Bluetooth device, it is surprisingly not bad, and doesn't feel like there is any noticable latency during a casual gaming session.The microphone also proves useful in voice chat while gaming.",0,0,1,1,1,0

You can hear new notes of your favourite songs, overall it'll give you a premium experience. Mic is also pretty good, audio is clear on both ends during a call, I wanted a headphone which can help me with great music and clear calls, and only this one could manage both at this price range, hence no complains on performance. Connectivity is pretty good, connects as soon as you turn the device on. The battery must be massive, as it can run for months with moderate usage.

It looks pretty good with impressive fit and finish. The buttons feel well built yet the headphone is quite light. It did not hurt my ears even after long hours of continuous use.Sound Quality: I am an audio visual production professional and I felt it sounds quite balanced (for a JBL) in the Eq off setting. Pump up the volume and it can get pretty loud. The 'super bass' eq mode really pumps up the bass. The bass response is deep with precise attacks and releases, does not sound boomy at all. I like how these headphones sound. The calling quality too is surprisingly good. It cuts most ambient noises coming into the microphone while on a phone call.ANC: Does the job Okay but there are much better ANC headphones available in the market. Compared to the Bose Quiet series, the apple airpods pro or even the Sony headphones with ANC these felt inferior. In my recent travel in an airplane, these headphones started crackling; especially while the airplane was taking off. The filtration of the aircraft engine sound kept varying throughout my three hours of flying.Ergonomics: It takes a little while to get used to the position of the buttons. I felt that the ANC on-off toggle button should have been placed on the other earpiece of the headphone and not along with the power button or the volume control/play-pause buttons. Again, takes a while to get used to this button position. The charging port is on the top side of the right earpiece. Thus, you cannot use the headphones while charging them. The wired connection option is definitely a handy option if you want to use them connected to a computer on a table. The wire is a TRRS jack and kept playing in mono when connected to a TRS only socket.Battery Backup: Very good battery backup so even with a continuous use with ANC for approx 6 hours and with about 60% volume on music and multiple phone calls, it just consumed 40% charge.Overall verdict: It's a good buy only if you have budget constraints and you're offered hefty discounts. If not then there are far better ANC headphones available in the market.",1,1,1,1,1,1

From the moment I unboxed them, I could tell these headphones were designed with quality and comfort in mind.The noise-canceling feature is truly remarkable, creating a serene listening environment even in noisy surroundings. Whether IâÃÃ´m on a busy street or working in a bustling office, the outside world fades away, leaving me to enjoy my music, podcasts, or calls without any distractions.The sound quality is, as expected from JBL, outstanding. The bass is punchy without being overwhelming, mids are clear, and the highs are crisp. Every genre of music sounds vibrant and full of life through these headphones. They also perform excellently during calls, with the microphone delivering clear, distortion-free audio.Comfort is another area where the JBL Tune 770NC shines. The plush ear cushions and adjustable headband ensure a snug fit that I can wear for hours without any discomfort. The lightweight design also makes them ideal for long listening sessions.The battery life is fantastic, lasting me through several days of use without needing a recharge. The quick charge feature is a lifesaver, giving me hours of playback with just a short charging session.Pairing the headphones with my devices was effortless, thanks to the reliable Bluetooth connection that remains strong and stable. The controls are intuitive and easy to use, allowing me to adjust volume, skip tracks, or answer calls with ease.Overall, the JBL Tune 770NC wireless headphones have become an essential part of my daily routine.

Sound quality and product quality is horrible. Paying 6-7k for this is a scam, as they offer the same performance as cheap boat headphones. The ANC is purely ceremonial, and warranty doesn't cover wearing of earpads. Speaking of earpads, the earpads on these don't last more than 8 months, forcing you to buy them from the website, which is 1/3rd of the cost of the headphones itself. There are major connectivity issues, due to which voice randomly starts breaking. Also, you cannot use the built in mic and the headphones at the same time in a video call, as it leads to horrible voice breaking and echo issues. I have tested this with 3 different laptops, all show the same issue, which shows the product is poorly engineered. The audio quality is what you would find on a cheap pair of Chinese headphones. The app is useless. You can go online on reddit and find many users that complain the same problems. This product is a mistake. This was my first time buying from JBL, and will certainly be the last time I ever buy from them. Don't waste your money on this, instead save more to buy a headphone from SONY, or spend less and buy a cheaper pair of headphones, as there is nothing on this which is better than a cheap pair of headphones.",0,1,0,1,1,1

Do not expect anything too good at this price point in a headphone. Music sounds like it's coming from a hollow space. Not recommended for EDM, Rock, Thrash Metal or anything with too much sub-bass and bass.As far as the fit goes, that's my biggest complaint. It feels like it doesn't cover your ears properly ever. And turning your head makes the cups lift slightly from the ear. It mat feel a little tight initially.The touch controls on the headphone are bad. It's is very difficult to accurately control the volume and track seeking with the touch. It either senses your touch properly, or simply doesn't.Mic quality is decent.Weight wise, the weigh around 600-650 gms. Not heavy.The appearance of the headphone is very good.",0,0,1,1,1,1

So this is a huge let down for me.2)Battery life - I personally havent tested it, as Im intending to use it with the aux cable. However, company advertised 8 hours is very low.Pros:1) Looks and feels very premium - This has to be the clutch feature of this headset. It looks very sleek and premium, and the build quality does feel sturdy and the built to last. Time is the ultimate test to built quality, and i shall update my review down the line if necessary.2) Noise cancellation - Its pretty good, does the job done. I was kinda apprehensive about this, but upn usage its pretty good for my use case scenario, which is to cut out all sorts os static noises. It does kinda let you hear outside coonversations if someone is speaking to you, other than that, for distant conversations, the seal is good enough. The noise cancellation is enough to keep you locked in anyway.3) Sound quality - Its not the best, however it provides with a very good reverb and surround effect, which gives you a very immersivbe experience.I bought the product for 1.7k, and hence it was a good deal.

The joints from where the headphones extends are made from plastic but reinforced with metal and gives a promising feel. Overall sturdy build for the price range.*Battery Life: The battery lasts impressively long on a single charge âÃÃ¬ easily gets me through days without needing to recharge. for the fact i have recieved these headphones with around 70% charge and since then i have charged these headphones only twice that too only for around 30 mins.*Sound Quality: The clarity and balance of sound is really good with Clear mids and highs. you can easily feel all the different instruments while listening to the music. The bass is also really good i wont say these are bass oriented headphones tho.*Comfort: The fit is really good for my head and the headphones are Lightweight and actually comfortable for extended wear. you can easily bingewatch wearing them. Best thing is the Soft ear pads that donâÃÃ´t press too hard.*Connectivity: Bluetooth connects instantly and Dual pairing works smoothly across my laptop and phone. although i have faced very few Dual pairing fails where it gets disconnected from both the devices and keeps on reconnecting untill you restart the connections.Cons:*Microphone: the microphone quality in these headphones are really bad and can sometimes be unusable if you are to talk slowly or when in outdoorsoverall if your budget is around 2500....you can go for these headphones which were really good for music and movies. The surround sounds are just so good. but dont buy these if you need them for calls.,1,1,1,1,1,1

I got this only for music and itâÃÃ´s serving up to the mark.Duel device connection works well.Battery life with ANC will declines little bit fast, although I am using it mostly without ANC.ANC: It works just fine, itâÃÃ´s a budget ANC headphones so I donâÃÃ´t expect much. Those who have used proper ANC headphones might find this one less efficient. For me it works fine.Music: Well what can I say? I had used sony a lot in the past, but was pre bluetooth era. This was really a great experience for me. EQ works really well and you can actually spot a difference when you adjust the difference. Sound is crisp and clear. You can really hear all the instruments clearly. Vocals are crispy too, not too much not less they have this little sweet spot! Bass is really great too, although you have to boost it a little bit, but basic settings may also work for you.App: So far I found app working well, you can connect and disconnect devices within app as well. EQ settings work well too, you can basically create your own custom EQ ( recommended for audiophiles). App looks little cluttered I guess they will change it in future.Volume: It is crazy loud given the size of drivers they have. I have only used it at 50% volume most of the time when I am at home, hardly went to 70% in public without any ANC. But I recommend you to use ANC if you are surrounded by too much noise in public.Size and Fit :These are over the ear, so they fit perfectly fine over your ears. I was actually surprised how good they fit over my ears. Cushions are very well made, have good texture and soft enough to not hurt your ears. The headphones are big enough to be recognised from a distance.Downsides:I really hoped they could have given carrying case because headphones themselves are sturdy but they still need protection while carrying.Also these are not foldable, so carrying them can be little difficult, you may have to purchase a separate carrying case.",1,1,1,1,1,1

It has good enough passive noise cancelling already for everyday use and the active noise cancelling makes it amazing to use in noisy environments like a flight or train or even a really loud fan in your room. Music quality is not 'amazing' but it's better than most and nothing to complain about. Battery life is good, and charges back up pretty quick too. Buttons are easy and intuitive to use. Fit and comfort is there, it's closed back so might be uncomfortable to use in hot/humid conditions.One thing I'm most impressed about is the bluetooth range,  I can keep my phone in my room and walk around wearing the headphones to the next room or the bathroom and it loses no signal, it's great. The strong bluetooth signal unfortunately seems to mess with wifi though, so I see some reduction in wifi speed when this is connected. Could just be a weakness of the wifi chip in my old phone though.Another quirk is that by default only 2 noise cancellation modes - ambient, and NC (noise cancellation) - were available in the headphones. I had to install the sony headphones app to enable the 3rd mode - off - which is what I use most of the time. Ambient mode lets outside sound like voices in so you can hear people talking even when you're wearing the headphones, but outside of that it sounds noisy and I don't use it all that much. And NC mode is full noise cancellation. If you want to turn it off altogether and use it as a passive headphones you have to install the app and enable the 3rd option.Overall very happy with my purchase.",1,0,1,1,1,0

This will likely be many people's first foray into the world of wireless headphones, and is likely to turn many people off by its many compromises. It might be worth buying your grandma as a gift, but is  not something I'd ever recommend buying for your own use.1. Sound Quality - awful. Honestly, the boAt Rockerz 450 does little more than bring your phone's audio loser to your ears. It isn't any significant improvement over your phone's speaker, and might actually be an active downgrade from your computer's speakers. Most audio sounds tinny, there's little to no bass, and absolutely zero noise cancellation. On or off, you can and will hear the outside world. Those who carry wireless headphones to tune out the outside world on walks or airplanes will be sorely disappointed. The soundstage is very small and shallow, and even non-audiophiles will notice the poor sound quality.2. Comfort - Horrendous. The boAt Rockerz 450 is a pain to wear, both literally and figuratively. The audio sounds horrible, and your ears will feel horrible too after an hour of use, maybe less. The good battery life means nothing if you cant use these headphones for more than 45 minutes at a time. After removing these headphones, your ears will hurt for a long while, and you'll feel like never wearing these again. The cans are very small, even for on-ear headphones, and people with spectacles or large heads will be even worse off. The frame doesn't extend very far, and also slips down quite easily.3. Build Quality - In a word - bad. See a pattern here? The headphones reflect their low price point, and are  entirely made of cheap plastic. The plastic also doesn't flex much, and the headphones seem very easy to break by accident. It's worth noting that the cups don't extend much. If you're one of those guys who like to leave their headphones dangling around their neck when not in use, you'll find yourself unable to lower your head without your headphones biting into your jaw. Finally, the cups absorb a lot of sweat. You'l find yourself wanting to wash the cups and frustrated that you can't. It's really gross.5. Mic - Absolutely trash tier. You won't even be able to use the mic for how bad it is. I honestly forgot these headphones even had a mic because it's so soft and picks up so much background noise. Callers will not be able to hear you clearly and will keep urging you to switch back to your phone, and you can forget about trying to use these with your PC for voice chat or conference calls. Don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a mic with this headset - the mic only exists on paper. It's really not worth using.4. Final words - Just, don't. Spend a bit more, get a decent pair of wireless headphones. The headset doesn't even connect properly half the time, and when it does, you'll wish it didn't. Save  up some money, work at McDonalds, and treat yourself to some good headphones. Anything, but not these ones. The only good thing about these cans is the battery life, but what use it battery life if you don't want to use these headphones?1 Build",1,1,1,1,1,0

Initially, I was excited about the design and sound quality, which seemed decent for the price. However, within just a day of use, the left side of the headphones stopped working completely. This is extremely disappointing, especially for a brand that's usually known for reliable audio products.The headphones felt comfortable and paired easily with my devices, but what's the point if it? I expected better. If this is a common issue, I would recommend steering clear of this model. I'll be seeking a replacement or refund, but for now, my experience with the Rockerz 450 Pro has been underwhelming.Pros:Good designComfortable fitDecent sound (while it lasted)Cons:Left side stopped working within a dayWould not recommend unless they fix the quality issues.",0,1,1,1,1,0

It captures my voice very well, and is much better than the mic. on my phone or my webcam.The size is good.It's not too bulky so it is comfortable.The cushioning provides great comfort as well.I also used it for gaming, and it performed amazing in that as well.While the latency is inevitable in any Bluetooth device, it is surprisingly not bad, and doesn't feel like there is any noticable latency during a casual gaming session.The microphone also proves useful in voice chat while gaming.",0,0,1,1,1,0

These are fine only with the person having smaller or average size.3) It doesnt suit for gaming.4) Sound mixture of high and low can be designed well as i feel its flat in few places where it could have been better.,1,0,1,1,1,1
